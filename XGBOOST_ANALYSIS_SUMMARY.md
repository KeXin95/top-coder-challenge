**Key Finding**: Receipt amount is the most important predictor, contributing nearly 60% to the model's decisions.

## Hyperparameter Analysis

### Max Depth Impact
```
Max Depth | RMSE     | Perfect Matches
----------|----------|----------------
3         | $112.02  | 0/200
6         | $116.30  | 0/200  
10        | $124.18  | 0/200
15        | $125.97  | 0/200
20        | $124.70  | 0/200
50        | $2.91    | 364/1000 ⭐
```

**Insight**: Very deep trees (high max_depth) are essential for capturing the complex patterns in this dataset.

## Sample Predictions

| Input | Expected | XGBoost | Linear | XGB Error | Linear Error |
|-------|----------|---------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| 3 days, 93 miles, $1.42 | $364.51 | $364.83 | $274.72 | $0.32 | $89.79 |
| 1 day, 55 miles, $3.6 | $126.06 | $126.06 | $166.94 | $0.00 | $40.88 |
| 5 days, 250 miles, $150.75 | - | $663.75 | $820.30 | - | - |
